I am introducing you to my beautiful profile on Github, which was created for taking a part in some
open source projects.
Main languages which I am using are: Java, CPP and Python. I am most interested in web development, mainly backend. I could write Apps in some popular frameworks, for example Spring, Hibernate.


I have as well my own youtube channel: m.ananech
Instagram: m.ananicz
Where I am trying to show my personality.

Quantum computing is the future!

I would like to create my own website which you should be ready for!
