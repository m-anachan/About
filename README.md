I am introducing you to my beautiful profile on Github, which was created for taking a part in some
open source projects.
Main languages which I am using are: Python, CPP and Java. I am most interested in software development, mainly artificial intelligence. I write code using some popular libraries, for example Pytorch, Tensorflow.

Quantum computing will be probably much better for computations than conventional computing and will be used in business, this is the subject in which I am interested in.

Artificial Intelligence is the future!
